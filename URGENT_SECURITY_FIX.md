# URGENT SECURITY FIX REQUIRED

## CRITICAL ISSUE: Users get ALL tokens before pool creation!

### Current BROKEN Flow:
1. ALL 1 billion tokens minted to user wallet
2. User can cancel remaining transactions
3. User keeps everything, no pool created
4. Platform gets nothing

### What Actually Happened in Your Last Transaction:
- Token: `4hfKBM8qNdJj3ufUXNiGSbBau3pu3D4XfDQAVDc3ctHc` (Barsad)
- User got: 1,000,000,000 tokens (ENTIRE SUPPLY!)
- Pool got: 0 tokens (user would need to transfer)
- Result: User can rug pull

### IMMEDIATE FIX NEEDED:

1. **Change Token Minting Logic in `/src/utils/solana.ts`**:
   - Line ~416: `const mintAmount = params.supply;` 
   - Should be: `const mintAmount = params.retainedAmount || 0;`

2. **Create Pool Token Account First**:
   - During pool creation, mint liquidity tokens directly to pool vault
   - Never give liquidity tokens to user

3. **Fix Pool ID Display**:
   - Already fixed in `raydium-v2.ts`

### Secure Workflow:
```
1. Create mint (keep authority)
2. Mint ONLY retention to user (80M out of 1B)
3. Create pool 
4. Mint liquidity (920M) DIRECTLY to pool vault
5. Revoke mint authority
```

### Why This Matters:
- Current: User gets 1B tokens, can cancel and run
- Secure: User gets 80M, pool gets 920M automatically
- No trust required!
