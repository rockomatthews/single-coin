# Fixes Summary

## ✅ FIXED:

1. **Priority Fees Increased** (All files updated to 50,000 microLamports)
   - `src/utils/solana.ts` - ✓
   - `src/utils/metaplex.ts` - ✓
   - `src/hooks/useTokenCreation.ts` - ✓

2. **Pool ID Display Fixed**
   - `src/utils/raydium-v2.ts` - Now correctly shows poolId, vaultA, etc.

3. **Token Minting Security** (PARTIALLY FIXED)
   - `src/utils/solana.ts` - Now only mints retention amount to user
   - Logs show: "SECURE MINTING: Only minting X tokens to user"
   - Mint authority is retained for pool creation

## ❌ STILL BROKEN:

1. **Authority Revocation Timing**
   - Currently revokes BEFORE pool creation
   - Should revoke AFTER pool creation
   - Need to modify `useTokenCreation.ts` workflow

2. **Liquidity Token Minting**
   - Liquidity tokens are NOT being minted to pool
   - Need to add minting during pool creation
   - Raydium pool creation needs to mint tokens to vault

3. **Image Display**
   - IPFS URL is correct but not showing on homepage
   - Need to check database saving/querying

## What Happened in Your Last Transaction:

Despite the fixes in solana.ts, the OLD compiled code was still running, which:
- Minted ALL 1B tokens to user
- Created pool with 0 tokens
- User kept everything

## Next Steps:

1. **Update useTokenCreation.ts**:
   - Don't revoke authorities until AFTER pool creation
   - Pass mint keypair to pool creation

2. **Update raydium-v2.ts**:
   - Add logic to mint liquidity tokens to pool vault
   - Only after tokens are in pool, signal to revoke authority

3. **Rebuild and Deploy**:
   - Clear build cache
   - Force new deployment
   - Test with small amounts first
