# Solana Network Congestion Guide

## Current Issue
The Solana network is experiencing high congestion, causing transactions to timeout even though they may succeed. This is happening at the token minting stage, preventing the liquidity pool creation.

## What's Happening
1. **Mint Creation**: ✅ Succeeds (creates the token account)
2. **Token Minting**: ❌ Times out (but may still succeed)
3. **Liquidity Pool**: ❌ Never reached due to minting timeout

## Immediate Solutions

### 1. Use a Premium RPC Endpoint (Recommended)
The free public RPC is overwhelmed. Consider using:
- **Helius**: https://helius.dev (Free tier available)
- **QuickNode**: https://quicknode.com
- **Alchemy**: https://alchemy.com

To use a custom RPC:
1. Sign up for a service
2. Get your RPC URL
3. Update your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://your-rpc-endpoint.com
```

### 2. Retry Failed Transactions
When you see a timeout error with a transaction signature, check it on Solscan:
```
https://solscan.io/tx/YOUR_TRANSACTION_SIGNATURE
```

### 3. Manual Token Recovery
If a mint was created but tokens weren't minted (Supply = 0), you can manually mint them using Solana CLI or a script.

## Why This Happens
- Solana processes ~4,000 transactions per second
- During high demand, transactions queue up
- The 30-second timeout is too short for congested periods
- Your transaction is likely in the queue but not confirmed yet

## Future Improvements
1. Implement better retry logic (already added)
2. Use priority fees for faster processing
3. Batch operations when possible
4. Show real-time network status to users

## Check Your Recent Attempts
- First attempt: Mint `G61MLDVC7EnqAEyp2cFhjxvJrzAPasLDJcErxukXDd1T` (created, 0 supply)
- Second attempt: Mint `w4aNbgzhZEDU9Yxgu8L2tpraeaGwf67mfY8ae59Qysj` (created, 0 supply)

Both mints exist but need their tokens minted!
